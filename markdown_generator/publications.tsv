2018-01-13	Graph-Based Decoding for Event Sequencing and Coreference Resolution	7th International Conference on Computational Linguistics(COLING 2018)	We study two types of relation: Event Coreference and Event Sequencing. We show that the popular tree-like decoding structure for automated Event Coreference is not suitable for Event Sequencing. To this end, we propose a graph-based decoding algorithm that is applicable to both tasks.	coling2018sequencing	https://hunterhector.github.io/files/papers/Liu,_Mitamura,_Hovy_-_2018_-_Proceedings_of_the_27th_International_Conference_on_Computational_Linguistics.pdf

2017-11-07	JointSem: Combining Query Entity Linking and Entity based Document Ranking	Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2017)	This work presents JointSem, a joint semantic ranking system that combines query entity linking and entity-based document ranking. In JointSem, the spooing and linking signals are used to describe the importance of candidate entities in the query, and the linked entities are utilized to provide additional ranking features for the documents.	cikm2017joint	https://hunterhector.github.io/files/papers/Xiong_et_al._-_2017_-_Proceedings_of_the_26th_ACM_International_Conference_on_Information_and_Knowledge_Managem.pdf

2016-06-16	Exploring the steps of Verb Phrase Ellipsis	Proceedings of the Workshop on Coreference Resolution Beyond OntoNotes (CORBON 2016), co-located with NAACL 2016	Verb Phrase Ellipsis is a well-studied topic in theoretical linguistics but has received little attention as a computational problem. Here we propose a decomposition of the overall resolution problem into three tasks: target detection, antecedent head resolution, and antecedent boundary detection and implement a number of computational approaches for each one.	naacl_2016vpe	https://hunterhector.github.io/files/papers/Liu_VPE_NAACL16.pdf	https://github.com/hunterhector/VerbPhraseEllipsis

We show that subevents can form a particular hierarchical event structure. This paper examines a novel two-stage approach to finding and improving subevent structures.	lrec2014subevent	https://hunterhector.github.io/files/papers/Araki_et_al._-_2014_-_Proceedings_of_the_Ninth_International_Conference_on_Language_Resources_and_Evaluation_LREC14.pdf
