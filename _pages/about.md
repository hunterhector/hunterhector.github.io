I am Zhengzhong Liu (People often call my nickname Hector), a PhD student on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I work with Professor [Teruko Mitamura](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~teruko/) and Professor [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/). Prior to my PhD, I also obtained my master at CMU with Teruko and Ed. And prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree in [Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/) from [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), working with Professor [Qin Lu](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csluqin/). 

My research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to linguistic problems. During my PhD, I focus on modeling event semantics, which includes event detection, event coreference, script modeling and salience modeling.

I sometimes touch other language related topics, including entity modeling, such as disambiguation, linking, coreference and salience;  information retrieval. I also work on deep learning topics and tools. 

Thesis

My [thesis proposal](https://hunterhector.github.io/files/thesis/proposal_draft.pdf) summarizes some of my previous work. We are proposing to deliver two solutions to two problems we observed in event research:
1. Computational Perspective
  - Problem: Dilemma on labelled data for difficult semantic tasks. Such tasks are very difficult to be annotate because of the task complexity for human; but we at the same time require a lot of data to train such tasks because the task complexity for machines as well. 
  - Proposed solution: we are proposing to bring data together, such as jointly using multiple datasets, or looking for incidental supervision signals.
1. Linguistic Perspective
  - Problem: Common approaches on analyzing event relations typically assumes the shared frame elements are identical, this is not always the case.
  - Proposed solution: We adopt the quasi-identity theory on coreference and propose to solve the problem with a slightly different framework.
