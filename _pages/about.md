My [thesis proposal (draft)](https://hunterhector.github.io/files/thesis/proposal_draft.pdf) summarizes some of my previous work. We are proposing to deliver two solutions to two problems we observed in event research:
1. Computational Perspective
  - Problem: Dilemma on labelled data for difficult semantic tasks. Such tasks are very difficult to be annotate because of the task complexity for human; but we at the same time require a lot of data to train such tasks because the task complexity for machines as well. 
  - Proposed solution: we are proposing to bring data together, such as jointly using multiple datasets, or looking for incidental supervision signals.
1. Linguistic Perspective
  - Problem: Common approaches on analyzing event relations typically assumes the shared frame elements are identical, this is not always the case.
  - Proposed solution: We adopt the quasi-identity theory on coreference and propose to solve the problem with a slightly different framework.
