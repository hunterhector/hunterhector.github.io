excerpt: 'Verb Phrase Ellipsis is a well-studied topic in theoretical linguistics but has received little attention as a computational problem. Here we propose a decomposition of the overall resolution problem into three tasks: target detection, antecedent head resolution, and antecedent boundary detection and implement a number of computational approaches for each one.'

Verb Phrase Ellipsis is a well-studied topic in theoretical linguistics but has received little attention as a computational problem. Here we propose a decomposition of the overall resolution problem into three tasks: target detection, antecedent head resolution, and antecedent boundary detection and implement a number of computational approaches for each one.
